1. Nf3 { Notes by Raymond Keene. } Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. Nc3 Nc6
4. e3 e6 5. d4 d5 6. cxd5 Nxd5 7. Bd3 cxd4 {Perhaps 7...Be7 is
more accurate, maintaining the central tension.} 8. exd4 Be7
9. O-O O-O {One of the classical isolated queen's pawn
positions, in which White's extra space and attacking chances
compensate for the structural weakness.} 10. Re1 Nf6 {A solid
alternative is 10...Bf6 11 Be4 etc.} 11. Bg5 {!? Fashionable
was 11 a3, but the text is not bad. All White's pieces are
coming out at great speed while Black still has problems
completing his queenside development.} 11...Nb4 {The immediate
11...b6 deserves attention. Black's plan to dominate the
blockade square d5 instantly is possibly too straightforward.}
12. Bb1 b6 {12...Bd7 is a more cautious treatment, planning a
later development with ...Bc6.} 13. Ne5 Bb7 {It might look as
if Black is over the worst but now a vicious attack appears
almost out of nowhere.} 14. Re3 {!! A difficult and bold
move. When I played it I already had to be sure that my
kingside attacking chances would be sufficient compensation
for my lack of queenside development and the clumsy position
of my rook on the third rank. Strangely, a similar rook
manoeuvre occurred in a game Filip - Pogats, played 14 years
previously, but neither Miles nor I had any notion of this
until I discovered the theoretical background after our
game. Incidentally, the Filip game ended in a draw.} 14...g6
{To prevent 15 Bxf6 Bxf6 16 Bxh7+ Kxh7 17 Qh5+ and 18 Rh3.}
15. Rg3 {! It looks odd to aim the rook against a granite wall
(g6) but the granite has faulty foundations. In contrast, the
more natural 15 Rh3 achieves nothing.} 15...Rc8 {?! At the
time the course I feared most was 15...Nc6! 16 Bh6 Qxd4! when
Black breaks White's attack by sacrificing the exchange. In
view of the lack of weaknesses in Black's position it would
then be a distinctly uphill struggle for White to win. After
the move played the solution became susceptible to precise
tactical analysis.} 16. Bh6 Re8 17. a3 Nc6 {17...Nbd5 does not
alter things significantly.} 18. Nxg6 {!} hxg6 19. Bxg6 {Apart
from capturing the bishop Black has two other defences: a)
19...Bf8 20 Bc2+ Kh8 21 Bxf8 Rxf8 22 Qd2 Ng8 23 Rh3+ Kg7 24
Rh7+ (Fritz gives 24 Qf4) 24...Kf6 25 d5+-; b) 19...Bd6 20
Bxf7+ Kxf7 21 Rg7+ Kf8 22 Qf3+-. In this position Black is
quite helpless, in spite of his extra material.} 19...fxg6
20. Qb1 {! An original square for the queen in a mating
combination, but neither 20 Qd3 Ne5 nor 20 Qc2 Ne5! 21 dxe5
Ne4 (exploiting the pin on the c-file) would be good enough
for White.} 20...Ne5 21. dxe5 Ne4 {Without the c-file pin this
is sheer desperation.} 22. Nxe4 Kh7 23. Nf6+ Bxf6 24. Qxg6+
Kh8 25. Bg7+ Bxg7 26. Qxg7# 1-0
